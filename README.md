Digital Humanities Lab - final group project @ Universiteit van Amsterdam

### Digital Humanities Lab - UvA

This is the final group project of the WG04 for the Digital Humanities Lab course at the Universiteit van Amsterdam

### Explanation

This project is a topic modelling tool, focusing on oriental philosophy. 
Due to ethical concerns and avoiding infringing any copyright laws, we did not upload the articles we used to conclude and write our project report.
However, from the Dictionary of Open Access Journals we uploaded a couple of open access articles, to demonstrate the topic modelling tool in motion, in the folder "open access journals".
In the repository, the scraping tool used to get the academic papers focusing on oriental philosophy from the online library Springer, can be found, under the name of "doi_scraper_api.html"
With the help of this scraper file, the user is able to get the links of the same documents we used to evaluate the performance of our program in the report, however, an insititutional access or subscription is still needed to access the academic articles.

For more explanation of the python package written for this project see:

    pydoc functions

    &

    pydoc functions.functions



### Usage of functions package

    from functions import [name of the function]

### Running the assignment's notebook file

To run the Jupyter Notebook, one does not necessarily need to do anything, just click the "Run all cells" button.
The user although is free to change arguments and variables for example in the topic generating cells, to adjust the program to the performance of their computer.
However, to run this Jupyter Notebook, one needs to have the following libraries installed in advance:

    pandas, nltk, gensim, PyPDF2, PyMuPDF
